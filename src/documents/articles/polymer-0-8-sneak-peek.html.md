The next release of Polymer, 0.8, is going to be a doozy. It's the first release on the "heading towards production" track and it's going to have some pretty massive differences from previous versions. So what exactly is new, and what's changing?

*Note: This data was gathered primarily from reading the [Polymer 0.8 Primer](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/blob/0.8-preview/PRIMER.md) which is very, very extensive. I'm just hitting the highlights. Also note that any of this could change before the final release is cut.*
