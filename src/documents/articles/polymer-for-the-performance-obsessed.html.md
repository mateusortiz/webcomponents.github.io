I'm building a small web app at the moment, and so I've taken the opportunity to give Polymer 1.0 a proper test drive. The question I was asking myself: can I get all these goodies without making users pay a huge performance cost?

I’ll be blunt about my feelings on Polymer 0.5, which I considered a framework: it gave me all the wrong feels. It tried to do so much, and in one go, and it  like eating a 5 course dinner when all you wanted was a salad. After all, there’s no hard requirement to make your own elements. Semantic markup does just fine, and it’s hard to beat the browser at components that its engineers have had years to refine.
