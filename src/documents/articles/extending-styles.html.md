The point of extending styles is to reuse code. If youâ€™ve defined some base-level styles, you want to be able to use those styles again without having to rewrite them. And if you need to change those base-level styles, you want those changes to propagate throughout.

Simply reusing code is easy. But reusing code in a way that is predictable, maintainable, and scalable is hard. Fortunately, computer scientists have been studying these problems for decades, and a lot of the principles of good software design apply to CSS as well
