On May 29, 2015, the polymer team announced the release of Polymer 1.0.  Since the release of Polymer 0.5 developer preview, the team has rewritten the library from the ground up, with increased performance and better functionality as results.

Polymer is one of the first implementations of a user interface library built upon the Web Components standard. Web Components are not fully supported by browsers, but they provide a polyfill library, webcomponents.js, that provides enough functionality to support Web Components and Polymer.
