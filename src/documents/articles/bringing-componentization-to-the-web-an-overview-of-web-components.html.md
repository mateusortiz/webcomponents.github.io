Four of our five most-requested platform features on UserVoice (Shadow DOM, Template, Custom Elements, HTML Imports) belong to the family of features called Web Components. In this post we’ll talk about Web Components and give our viewpoint, some background for those who may not be intimately familiar with them, and speculate a bit about where we might expect them to evolve in the future. To do it justice requires a bit of length, so sit back, grab a coffee (or non-caffeinated beverage) and read-on. In part two (coming tomorrow), we’ll address questions about our roadmap and plans for implementation.
