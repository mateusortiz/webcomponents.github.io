WebComponents.org is a community project. We truly believe that in order for something to be fully embraced by the community, it needs to be transparent. Starting from now, we're going to share statistics that are often not publicized by other open source projects.

<!-- Excerpt -->

Hopefully, those numbers will help you understand where we are and where are we going. More than that, it can give you some insights on how we can make this better together.

Today, we're going to measure what happened from *January 1, 2015* to *March 31, 2015* across few different spectrums.

## Site

The site is probably the heart of this organization, it's our hub to distribute content. We use same old Google Analytics with some [custom events](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponents.github.io/blob/site/src/partials/card-links.html.eco#L7) being tracked. Also, we record sessions and obtain heatmaps using [Inspectlet](http://www.inspectlet.com/).
