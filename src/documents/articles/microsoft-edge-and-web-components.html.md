Yesterday, we shared [our thoughts on the promise of Web Components](http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/07/14/bringing-componentization-to-the-web-an-overview-of-web-components/). In this post, we’ll answer a couple of recurring questions we get about the technology, including our implementation roadmap and how we currently think about its priority in regards to other related platform work. We’re excited about the potential of these technologies, and today we’re excited to announce that we’re [beginning development on the HTML Template element](http://dev.modern.ie/platform/status/templateelement), one of the core Web Components technologies and the [#3 UserVoice request](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6261273-template-element) from developers.
