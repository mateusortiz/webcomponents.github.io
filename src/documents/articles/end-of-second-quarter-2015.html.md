In the [past article](/articles/end-of-first-quarter-2015), we saw some numbers from the first quarter. That was nice because we could see exactly what was happening on each channel: [Site](/), [GitHub](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponents.github.io), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/web_components/).

Today, we're not only analyzing what happened from *April 1, 2015* to *June 30, 2015*, we'll also compare those numbers with Q1 to check what we did right and what we can improve.

<!-- Excerpt -->

## Site

### How many people accessed this?

* Users: 89,585 <small class="negative">⬇0.42%</small>
* Sessions: 129,518 <small class="negative">⬇2.77%</small>
* Pageviews: 233,491 <small class="negative">⬇2.36%</small>

Compared to the last quarter we had a slightly decrease in the number of visitors. It's nothing to worry about, specially if you see the raw numbers.

Our goal for next quarter is to hit 100,000 unique users. Pretty ambitious, huh?

### Where did they visited from?

1. United States: 34,699 (26.79%) <small class="negative">⬇2.54%</small>
2. India: 7,056 (5.45%) <small class="positive">⬆20.95%</small>
3. Germany: 7,038 (5.43%) <small class="positive">⬆0.49%</small>
4. United Kingdom: 6,730 (5.20%) <small class="negative">⬇9.48%</small>
5. Brazil: 5,758 (4.45%) <small class="positive">⬆24.34%</small>

By looking at our visitors we notice that UK dropped from 2nd to the 4th position. At the same time, emerging countries like India and Brazil had an impressive increase of interest.

We stimulate diversity and we'll keep doing that.

### What did they like to see?

1. [Home](/): 102,023 (43.69%) <small class="negative">⬇3.17%</small>
2. [Polyfills](/polyfills): 27,444 (11.75%) <small class="positive">⬆5.68%</small>
3. [Introduction to HTML Imports](/articles/introduction-to-html-imports): 11,606 (4.97%) <small class="negative">⬇40.28%</small>
4. [Articles](/articles): 11,271 (4.83%) <small class="negative">⬇4.61%</small>
5. [Presentations](/presentations): 8,780 (3.76%) <small class="negative">⬇12.71%</small>

That *HTML Imports* article was featured in the homepage for a long time, that's why it had so many visits (besides being a great article of course). This huge decrease of visits is expected as we rotate featured articles.

For the next quarter, we'll try to add more articles and presentations. Those sections are crucial and we can't let them inactive.

### Which external links did they click?

1. [CustomElements.io](http://customelements.io/): 6,210 (19.86%) <small class="positive">⬆15.53%</small>
2. [Built with Polymer](http://builtwithpolymer.org/): 3,961 (12.67%) <small class="negative">⬇0.20%</small>
3. [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/): 3,828 (12.24%) <small class="negative">⬇0.18%</small>
4. [Component Kitchen](http://component.kitchen/): 3,283 (10.50%) <small class="negative">⬇3.87%</small>
5. [Custom Elements Spec](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/): 2,992 (9.57%) <small class="negative">⬇28.54%</small>

The *Specs* card used to be located in the top of the page, whereas the *Discover* card used to be located in the bottom. We noticed that most of the clicks were coming from this card in the bottom, so we switched them. That's why there's an increase of clicks for *CustomElements.io* and a decrease for the *Custom Elements Spec* link.

The homepage is a hub to other pages, we'll continue monitoring that kind of behavior and changing card positions based on what users like the most.

## GitHub

### How many commits we pushed?

* 50 commits <small class="negative">⬇59.67%</small>

We had a tremendous decrease of commits compared to the last quarter. There are many reasons for that but I would like to highlight one which is our current stack. We use [DocPad](https://github.com/docpad/docpad/), a static generator in Node which is not as maintained as it used to be in the past. It is slowing us down and discouraging contributions.

Our goal is to move to a different Node static generator and we would love to hear your suggestions.

### Who pushed those commits?

1. [Erik Isaksen](https://github.com/Nevraeka): 22 <small class="negative">⬇53.19%</small>
2. [Zeno Rocha](https://github.com/zenorocha): 20 <small class="negative">⬇68.25%</small>
3. [Matheus Ortiz](https://github.com/mateusortiz): 7 <small class="positive">⬆40%</small>
4. [Pascal Precht](https://github.com/PascalPrecht): 1 <small class="positive">⬆100%</small>

Some personal reasons led me to stepping away from GitHub a little bit in the past months. But the good news is that now I'm back and there's a new top contributor around: Erik Isaksen! What I can tell is that this guy has been tireless and extremely helpful.

For next quarter, I would like to get rid of that *Community* card in the homepage. Instead, I would like to highlight these new faces that are keeping this project active.

## Twitter

### How many tweets were published?

* 29 tweets <small class="positive">⬆3.57%</small>

We published just one tweet more than we did last quarter.

That's a comfortable number since we try not to pollute our follower's streams so much.

### How people interacted with those tweets?

* 484 retweets <small class="positive">⬆97.55%</small>
* 595 favorites <small class="positive">⬆49.87%</small>
* 3,200 link clicks <small class="positive">⬆88.23%</small>
* 141,000 impressions <small class="positive">⬆37.69%</small>

What is impressive though, is that even with the same amount of tweets, we had a HUGE increase of engagement.

It's going to be a hard task to maintain those numbers but nothing in life is easy, right?

### Which were the most popular tweets?
