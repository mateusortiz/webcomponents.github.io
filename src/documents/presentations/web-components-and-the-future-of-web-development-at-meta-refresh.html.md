There is a fundamental problem with HTML and JavaScript that makes it hard to build reusable components / widgets - The DOM contents of the component is not encapsulated from the rest of the page.

Today we overcome most of these problems by following certain conventions and assumptions. "Web Components" is a set of cutting-edge standards to solve these problems.
