Getting the most out of web components requires a change in mindset. Component Kitchen founder Jan Miksovsky presents a set of principles for creating components that can quickly be remixed and adapted in a variety of applications. This is a more advanced talk that assumes basic familiarity with web components and Googleâ€™s Polymer framework.

<!-- Excerpt -->

The [source code for all demos](https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/polytechnic-demos) in this talk are posted on GitHub. The talk references a set of [Ten Principles for Great General Purpose Web Components](https://github.com/basic-web-components/components-dev/wiki/Ten-Principles-for-Great-General-Purpose-Web-Components).

This talk was the second in a series of two. The first, introductory talk is [Web Components 101: An Introduction to Fundamental Changes in HTML](/presentations/components-101-intro-to-fundamental-changes-in-html/).
