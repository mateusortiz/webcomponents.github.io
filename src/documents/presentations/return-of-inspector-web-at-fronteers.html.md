A little over a year ago at JSConf EU, Angelina tried to inspire developers to take an interest in Web Components, which includes Shadow Dom, HTML Templates, HTML Imports, and Custom Elements.

<!-- Excerpt -->

In this talk we'll take a look at how far we've come in a year: what has been implemented, what hasn't, the current state of the relevant specifications, and discuss various frameworks and libraries that have emerged either with patterns similar to web components or embracing the technology completely. We will take a look at these changes, and also dive into some code for a comprehensive overview of 'the state of things' - spoiler: it's still always changing.
