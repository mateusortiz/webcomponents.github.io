Divs, nested divs and more nested divs… A pretty web UI with nasty markups is a big turn-off. Now with a new set of new W3C web platform primitives called Web Components, we can encapsulate UI and complex functionalities, just like packing data and functions into a single component, and restrict the access in object-oriented programming.

<!-- Excerpt -->

The web components don’t add ugly children in your DOM tree, in fact, they are separated from the tree. The DOM-related methods like getElementById() doesn’t give you an access inside! So, how can you use the encapsulated components and also obtain the access inside and style them?
