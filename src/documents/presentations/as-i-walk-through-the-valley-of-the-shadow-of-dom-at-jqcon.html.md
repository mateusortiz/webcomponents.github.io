Let's party like it’s the late 1990's — When the Components spec was [originally introduced](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-HTMLComponents) and 2Pac was livin' in a gangsta's paradise. While the implementation of this paradigm is long overdue, at least it's been a sufficient amount of time for Microsoft to forget [Google stole their idea](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/).

<!-- Excerpt -->

In this presentation, we'll look at each piece of the Web Components spec including Templates, Decorators, Custom Elements, The Shadow Dom, and HTML Imports. We'll also look at how this may integrate with ECMAScript 6 Modules to create a truly modularized, encapsulated, decoupled web.

Although Web Components are not yet ready for use in production we'll look at how we can be building our applications with components in mind, and how frameworks like Angular, Ember, and Polymer are already doing so. This is not only one of the most exciting specs in draft, it's also one of the most important paradigm shifts in web development since Al Gore created the internet.
