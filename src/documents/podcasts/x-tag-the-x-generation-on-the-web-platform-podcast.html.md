Daniel Buchner talks about the X-Tag project and some if its interesting features. The Web Platform Podcast discusses the Web Component specs and much more. Big companies like Google have thrown their full support behind the Web Components technology umbrella. Will others such as Microsoft follow suit? And what will it take for browser vendors to implement web components natively?
