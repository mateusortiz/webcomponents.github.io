Daniel Buchner talks with The Web Platform Podcast on x-tag, the Custom Elements library competitor to Polymer, that he created alongside former Mozillian & Kraken Developer, Arron Schaar.

<!-- Excerpt -->

X-Tag is an interesting way to work with web components in that it takes a totally imperative approach to creating Web Components as opposed to the declarative way of building with libraries like Polymer. Some features include legacy browser support, optional mixins to share across components, & functional pseudos to assist in delegation.
