Mozilla Brick contributors Matt Claypotch and Soledad Penades join The Web Platform Podcast to talk about building UI focused Web Components for 'Mobile First' Web Development.

<!-- Excerpt -->

Mozilla Brick is a set of 'Mobile First' focused Web Components built 'as close to the specs as possible'. Brick is not a library built on top of Web Components like Polymer, Instead, it is a collection of elements with as little abstraction as possible. Brick's goal has been to make building the interface of web applications easier. UI is not as easy for many developers to build from scratch and it can be difficult to get performant, usable, and attractive widgets.
